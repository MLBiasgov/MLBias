The US Census Bureau xD team, in collaboration with the [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov) program, is building a library of machine learning and artificial intelligence resources to help combat bias introduced by bias and algorithms. 

This collection currently includes a syllabus for beginners, executable Jupyter Notebooks, an annotated list of resources, and other prototpye components. 

This repository is for the design system code itself. We maintain [another repository for the documentation and website](https://github.com/uswds/uswds-site). To see the design system and its documentation on the web, visit [https://designsystem.digital.gov](https://designsystem.digital.gov).
